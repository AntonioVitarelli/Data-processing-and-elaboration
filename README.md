# Data-processing-and-elaboration
Group 2 – Data processing and elaboration

Sensors may return indirect measurements. It is important to
reconstruct the actual values thanks to calibration functions.
For example, we read a matric potential sensor with a custom
circuit. This circuit gives us a Frequency, that must be
converted back in the matric potential values.

WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
→ Convert the data of several sensors from frequency to
matric potential.

→ Plot the data to understand soil water condition

→ Determine if the sensors refer to correctly watered plants
or not

→ Present your results
